Last time I asked you I really got a lame excuse
I know that you lied
Now wicked things can happen...you see 'em goin' down in war
But when you play in a quiet way that bites it even more

 
Tell me what you want yeah 
I'll do it baby I promise right now
 

Who propped you up when you were stopped low motivation had you on the ground
I know your first reaction you slide away hide away goodbye
But if there's a doubt maybe I can give out a thousand reasons why
You have to say it isn't so... 


Say it isn't so, oh oh no 
 
Say it isn't so 

Oh, say it isn't so, oh oh no 
 

 

We like to be the strangers at the party, two rebels in a shell
 
You like to move with the best of them you know we, we move so well
Don't need someone to lean on, I know that there's an open door 
But if I'm faced with being replaced I want you even more, so baby say it isn't so... 

 
Oh, say it isn't so, oh oh no 
 
Say it isn't so 
 
Oh, say it isn't so, oh oh oh 
 


 
 

 
 

Why you wanna go do you hafta say you wanna go ooh ooh baby say it isn't... 

 
Say say say it isn't 
 so 
 

Why you hafta say it isn't 
 
So
 
So 
 

I know it's so hard for you... 
 
So hard 
 
Don't say it baby
 

There must be some other way 
Don't have to 
 
Some other way 
 
Aah 

You don't have to say 

Oh don't you say 
 

Oh you know I want to make you...
