The dark side's callin' now, nothin' is real
She'll never know just how I feel
From out of the shadows she walks like a dream
Makes me feel crazy, makes me feel so mean

Ain't nothin' gonna save you from a love that's blind
Slip to the dark side across that line
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah

Dark side's callin' now, nothin' is real
She'll never know just how I feel
From out of the shadows she walks like a dream
Make me feel crazy, make me feel so mean

Nothin' gonna save you from a love that's blind
Slip to the dark side across that line
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah

Ain't nothin' gonna save you from a love that's blind
Slip to the dark side across that line
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah

On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
