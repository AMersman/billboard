You don't ever need help from nobody else. All you got to do now:

Express yourself

What ever you do, do it good.
What ever you do, do it good. All right...

It's not what you look like, when you're doin' what you're doin'.
It's what you're doin' when you're doin' what you look like you're doin'!

They're doin' it on the moon, yeah...
In the jungle too.
Everybody on the floor, now.
Jumpin' like a kangaroo.
So let the horns do the thing they do, yo...

Some people have everything, and other people don't.
But everything don't mean a thing if it ain't the thing you want.

Oh, do it! Oh, do it
Do it to it
Go on and do it
Yo, do it
Give
