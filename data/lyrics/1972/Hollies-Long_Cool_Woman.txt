A-Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sittin' in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high

Bootlegging boozer on the West Side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman sing a song

A pair of Forty-Fives made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
With a 5'9" beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all, yeah

Woo!

I saw her head out to the table
With a tall walking big black cat
And Charlie said "I hope that you're able, boy
Hon', I'm telling you she knows where it's at"
Well, suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
A-jumping out of doors and tables
When I heard somebody shootin' a gun

Well, the DA was pumping my left hand
And a-she was a-holding my right
Well, I told her "Don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared"

I've gotta be forgiving
If I wanna spend my living
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9" beautiful tall
Well, with just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
Had it all, had it all
Had it all, had it all
Had it all, had it all
Ooh, had it all
Ha, she had it all, yeah
