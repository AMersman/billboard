Cry, cry baby
Cry baby
Cry baby
Welcome back home

Now he told you that he loved you
Much more than I
But he left you and you don't
You just don't know why
And when you don't know what to do
You come runnin' and start to

Cry, cry baby
Cry baby
Cry baby
Like you always do

Don't you know
Nobody can love you
The way I do, take the pain
And the heartache too, ah, honey you know I
Be around, when you need me
So go on and

Cry, cry baby
Cry baby
Cry baby
Welcome back home

{I've spent so many nights
Just waiting for you to come walkin' through that door
And even though you've made a fool of me so many times before
I know that all it takes is just the sight of your face
To make me realize that I'll always love you, darlin'
And I can see that you got some more tears to shed
I can see it baby, because your eyes, your eyes, are getting red
So, come on, come on, come one, come on, come on}

Go on and cry, cry baby
Cry baby
Cry baby
Cry baby
