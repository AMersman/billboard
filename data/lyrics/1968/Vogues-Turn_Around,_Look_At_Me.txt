There is someone walking behind you,
Turn around, look at me
There is someone watching your footsteps,
Turn around, look at me
There is someone who really needs you
Here is my heart in my hand
Turn around (turn around), look at me (look at me)
Undertstand, understand
That there's someone 
Who'll stand beside you
Turn around, look at me
And there's someone
to love and guide you
Turn around, look at me
O I've waited , but Iâ€˜ll wait forever
For you to come to me
Look at someone (Look at someone)
Who really loves you (yea loves you)
Turn around, look at me
Turn around, look at me
