Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on!

Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man?
Yeah!
And didn't I give you nearly everything
That a woman possibly can?
Honey, you know I did!

And each time I tell myself that I
Well I think I've had enough
But I'm gonna show you, baby
That a woman can be tough

I want you to come on, come on
Come on, come on and take it!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Oh, oh, break it!
Break another little bit of my heart now
Darling, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, have a!
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby

You know you got it
If it makes you feel good
Oh, yes indeed

You're out on the streets, looking good
And baby deep down in your heart
I guess you know that it ain't right
Never, never, never, never, never, never
Hear me when I cry at night
Babe and I cry all the time!

But each time I tell myself that I
Well I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms
I'll sing it once again

I'll say come on, come on
Come on, come on and take it!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it!
Break another little bit of my heart now
Darling, yeah
Oh, oh, have a!
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby

You know you got it, child
If it makes you feel good

I need you to come on, come on
Come on, come on and take it!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Oh, oh, break it!
Break another little bit of my heart, now
Darling, yeah, come on now
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you got it - whoah!

Take it!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it!
Break another little bit of my heart, now
Darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, hey

You know you got it, child
If it makes you feel good
