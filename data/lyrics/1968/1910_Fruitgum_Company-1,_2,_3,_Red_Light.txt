Every time I try to prove I love you, 
1, 2, 3, Red Light, you stop me,. 
Baby you ain't right to stop me. 
1, 2, 3, Red Light, you stop me. 
Every time I make a move to love you, 
1, 2, 3, Red Light, you stop me. 
Baby, every night you stop me. 
1, 2, 3, Red Light. 

Stop the game
You've got too much to lose. 
If you stop me again,
That's when we might end,
So don't refuse.

Every time I make a move to love you, 
1, 2, 3, Red Light, don't stop me. 
Baby you ain't right to stop me, 
1, 2, 3, Red Light won't stop me. 
Every time I try to prove I love you, 
1, 2, 3, Red Light won't stop me. 
When I know I'm right don't stop me. 
1, 2, 3, Red Light.
