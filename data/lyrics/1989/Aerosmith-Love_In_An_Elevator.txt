Yeah!

Workin' like a dog for the boss man (Whoa)
Workin' for the company (Whoa yeah)
I'm betting on the dice I'm tossing (Whoa)
I'm gonna have a fantasy (Whoa yeah)

But where am I gonna look?
They tell me that love is blind
I really need a girl like an open book
To read between the lines

Love in an elevator
Living it up when I'm going down
Love in a elevator, hoo
Loving it up 'til I hit the ground

Jackie's in the elevator (Whoa)
Lingerie, second floor (Whoa yeah)
She said, "Can I see you later (Whoa)
And love you just a little more?" (Whoa yeah)

I kinda hope we get stuck
Nobody gets out alive
She said, "I'll show you how to fax in the mail room, honey
And have you home by five"

Love in an elevator
Living it up when I'm going down
Love in an elevator, hoo
Loving it up 'til I hit the ground

In the air, in the air
Honey, one more time, now it ain't fair
Love in an elevator, hoo
Loving it up when I'm going down

Love in an

Elevator

Going down

Ahh

Love in an elevator, hoo
Loving it up when I'm going down
Love in an elevator, hoo
Living it up when I hit the ground

I'm gonna be a penthouse pauper (Whoa)
I'm gonna be a millionaire (Whoa yeah)
I'm gonna be a real fast talker (Whoa)
And have me a love affair (Whoa yeah)

I gotta get my timing right (Whoa)
It's a test that I gotta pass (Whoa yeah)
I'll chase ya all the way to the stairway, honey (Whoa)
Kiss your sassafras

Love in an elevator, hoo
Loving it up when I'm going down
Love in an elevator, hoo
Living it up 'til we hit the ground

Do you care? Do you care?
Honey, one more time, now it ain't fair

In the air, in the air
Honey, one more, one more, one more, yeah!
