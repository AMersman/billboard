Snap your fingers
I'll come running back to you, hmm
On bended knees
I said snap your fingers, I'll come running
I'll be true, take a chance on me
The lights turn green
Baby I gotta know, should I stay or go
Let me love you like a lover
Oh you use to know
Turn the key and let me in
Hmm through that same old door

I had it but I lost it
Now I've got a broken heart to mend
I don't care what the cost is
I gotta find a way back in
Snap your fingers,
I'll come running,
I'll do anything to get you back again
