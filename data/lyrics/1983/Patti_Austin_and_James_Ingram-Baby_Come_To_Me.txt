PATTI:
Thinkin' back in time
When love was only in my mind, I realize
Ain't no second chance
You've got to hold on to romance, don't let it slide
There's a special kind of magic in the air
When you find another heart that needs to share

CHORUS: BOTH
Baby, come to me, let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be and I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you ev'ry day, gotta have your love around me
Baby, always stay 'cause I can't go back to livin' without you

JAMES:
Spendin' ev'ry dime
To keep you talkin' on the line
That's how it was
And all those walks together out in any kind of weather
Just because
There's a brand-new way of looking at your life
When you know that they'll be standing by your side

CHORUS: BOTH

JAMES:
The nights can be cold
There's a chill to ev'ry evenin' when you're all alone

PATTI:
Don't talk anymore
'cause you know that I'll be here to keep you warm
(Oh, darling keep me warm)

CHORUS: BOTH
Baby, come to me, let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be and I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you ev'ry day, gotta have your love around me
Baby, always stay
PATTI: 'cause I can't go back to livin' without you

CHORUS: BOTH
Baby, come to me, let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be and I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you ev'ry day, gotta have your love around me
Baby, always stay
JAMES: 'cause I can't go back to livin' without you

CHORUS: BOTH
Baby, come to me, let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
FADE
and I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you ev'ry day, gotta have your love around me
Baby, always
