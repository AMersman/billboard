No one looked as I walked by
Just an invitation would have been just fine
Said no to him again and again
First he took my heart and then he ran

No one knows how I feel
What I said unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First he took my hand
Take me home

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room I did not hear from you
It's all right, it's all right
To be standing in a line
To be standing in a line
I cry

Do not turn away, my friend
Like a willow I can bend
No man calls my name
No man came

So I walked on down away from you
Maybe your attention was more than you could do
One man did not call
He asked me for my love and that was all

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room I did not hear from you
It's all right, it's all right
To be standing in a line
To be standing in a line
I cry

So I walked on down the line away from you
Maybe your attention was more than I could do
One man did not call
Well he asked me for my love
That was all

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room I did not hear from you
It's all right, it's all right
To be standing in a line
To be standing in a line
I cry
