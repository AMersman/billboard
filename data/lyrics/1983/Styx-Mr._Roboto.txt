You're wondering who I am
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
Machine or mannequin
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
With parts made in Japan
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
I am the modren man

I've got a secret I've been hiding
Under my skin
My heart is human, my blood is boiling
My brain IBM

So if you see me acting strangely
Don't be surprised
I'm just a man who needed someone
And somewhere to hide

To keep me alive
Just keep me alive
Somewhere to hide
To keep me alive

I'm not a robot without emotions
I'm not what you see
I've come to help you with your problems
So we can be free

I'm not a hero, I'm not a savior
Forget what you know
I'm just a man whose circumstances
Went beyond his control

Beyond my control
We all need control
I need control
We all need control

I am the modren man
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
Who hides behind a mask
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
So no one else can see
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
My true identity

Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto
Dōmo (dōmo)
Dōmo (dōmo)
Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto
Dōmo (dōmo)
Dōmo (dōmo)

Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto
Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto
Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto
Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto

Thank you very much, oh, Mr. Roboto
(Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto) 
For doing the jobs that nobody wants to
(Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto) 
And thank you very much, oh, Mr. Roboto
(Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto) 
For helping me escape just when I needed to
(Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto) 

Thank you, thank you, thank you
(Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto) 
I want to thank you
(Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto) 
Please, thank you
(Dōmo arigatō, Mr. Roboto) 
Oh, ya

The problem's plain to see
Too much technology
Machines to save our lives
Machines dehumanize

The time has come at last
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
To throw away this mask
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
Now everyone can see
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
My true identity

I'm Kilroy!
Kilroy!
Kilroy!
Kilroy!
