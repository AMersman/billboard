Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Tell me its real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that its real
Don't let love come just, to pass us by
Try, its all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love, last forever more

Baby you told me that you love me and u never leave my side
To the bitter end, through the thick and thin
You promised me baby that you weren't going anywhere, yes you did
Baby keep it real let me know just how you feel

Tell me its real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that its real
Don't let love come just, to pass us by
Try, its all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love, last forever more

I can't explain the way you made me feel, 
Every time that you told me that you loved me
And you know you did, too many times
Just when I thought that love could never be a part of me
That's when you came along, you showed me happiness
Baby you are the best, I think you're different from the rest
And I really love you

Tell me it's real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that its real
Don't let love come just, to pass us by
Try, its all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love, last forever more

Tell me it's real 
This feeling that I feel
Tell me its real

I know its real babe

Tell me its real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that its real
Don't let love come just, to pass us by
Try, its all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love, last forever more
