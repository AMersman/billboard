Oh, well, I'm...
Sittin' here in La-La
Waitin' for my Ya Ya
Sittin' here in La-La
Waitin' for my Ya Ya
It may sound funny
But I don't believe she's comin'

Baby hurry
Don't make me worry
Yeah baby, hurry
Don't make me worry
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you

Sittin' here in La-La
Waitin' for my Ya Ya
Sittin' here in La-La
Waitin' for my Ya Ya
It may sound funny
But I don't believe she's comin'

Baby hurry
Don't make me worry
Yeah baby, hurry
Don't make me worry
You know how I love you
Oh, how I love you

Sittin' here in La-La
Waitin' for my Ya Ya
Sittin' here in La-La
Waitin' for my Ya Ya
It may sound funny
But I don't believe she's comin'

Baby hurry
Don't make me worry
Yeah baby, hurry
Don't make me worry
You know how I love you...
