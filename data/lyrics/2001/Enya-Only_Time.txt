Who can say
Where the road goes
Where the day flows
Only time
And who can say
If your love grows
As your heart chose
Only time

Who can say
Why your heart sighs
As your love flies
Only time
And who can say
Why your heart cries
When your love lies
Only time

Who can say
When the roads meet
That love might be
In your heart.
And who can say
When the day sleeps
If the night keeps
All your heart.

Night keeps all your heart

Who can say
If your love grows
As your heart chose
Only time
And who can say
Where the road goes
Where the day flows
Only time

Who knows - only time
Who knows - only time
