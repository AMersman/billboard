It isn't fair

It isn't fair for you to taunt me.
How can you make me care this way?
It isn't fair for you to want me
If it's just for a day.

It isn't fair for you to thrill me.
Why do you do the things you do?
It isn't fair for you to fill me
With those dreams that can't come true, dear.

Why is it that you came into my life
And made it complete?
You gave me just a touch of high life;
If this is love then I repeat

It isn't fair for you to taunt me.
How can you make me care this way?
It isn't fair for you to want me
If it's just for today.

Why is it that you came into my life
And made it complete?
You gave me just a touch of high life;
If this is love then I repeat

It isn't fair for you to taunt me.
How can you make me care this way?
It isn't fair for you to want me
If it's just for today.
