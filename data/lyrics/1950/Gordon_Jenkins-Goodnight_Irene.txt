Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parted
I'm gonna take another stroll in town

Irene goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I take a great notion
To jump in the river and drown

Irene goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Stop ramblin'
Stop your gamblin'
Stop stayin' out late at night
Go home to your wife and family
Stay there by your fireside bright

Irene goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams
