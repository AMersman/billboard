I wanna be Loved
By Andrews Sisters

Oooo-ooooh

Oooo-ooooh

I wanna be loved,
(oooh)
With inspiration!
(oooh)
I wanna be loved,
Starting tonight!
(oooh)

Instead of merely
(oooh)
Holding conversation,
(oooh)
Hold me tight!

I wanna be kissed,
(aaaah)
Until I tingle!
(aaaah)
I wanna be kissed,
(aaaah)
Starting tonight!
(aaaah)

Embrace until 
our heartbeats intermingle,
Wrong or right!

I feel like acting my age!
I'm passed the stage of merely turtle-doving!
(Be careful! Be careful what you do!)
I'm in no mood to resist,
And I insist the world owes me a loving!
(oooh)

I wanna be thrilled
(oooh)
To desperation!
(oooh)
I wanna be thrilled,
(oooh)
starting tonight!
(Love me! Love me! Love me!)

With every kind of wonderful sensation!
I wanna be loved!
(aaaah)

I feel like acting my age!
I'm passed the stage of merely turtle-doving!
I'm in no mood to resist,
And I insist the world owes me a loving!

I wanna be thrilled to desperation!
(I wanna be thrilled!I wanna be thrilled!)
I wanna be thrilled, starting tonight!
(I wanna be thrilled tonight!)

With every kind of wonderful sensation,
I wanna be loved!
