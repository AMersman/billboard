Swing The Mood (Medley)
Jive Bunny And The Mastermixers

Come on everybody
Come on everybody

One-two-one-two
One-one-one-one-one
One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock
Five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock
Nine, ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock rock
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
Put your glad rags on and join me hon
We're gonna have some fun when the clock strikes one
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock rock rock until the broad daylight
We're gonna rock gonna rock around the clock tonight

Rock, rock, rock everybody
Roll, roll, roll everybody
Rock, rock, rock everybody
Roll, roll, roll everybody
Rock, rock, rock everybody
Rockin' with theÂ ??? beat

W-w-w-w-wake up, little Suzie, wake up
Wake up, little Suzie, wake up
We've both been sound asleep
Wake up little Suzie and weep
The movie's over it's four o'clock
And we're in trouble deep
Wake up little Suzie
Wake up little Suzie
We gotta go home

You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

Shake-shake-shake-shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll

A-well-a bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man
On a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm acting
Wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up

The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You should've heard them knocked out jailbirds sing
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

A-ah-ah-ah
A-ah-ah-ah
A-ah-ah-ah
At the hop, hop, hop-hop-hop

From: "If you lived here, you'd be home now."
