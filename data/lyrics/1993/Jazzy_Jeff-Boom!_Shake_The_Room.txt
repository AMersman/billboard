Yo back up now and give a brother room
The fuse is lit and I'm about to go boom
Mercy mercy mercy me
My life is a cage but on stage I'm free

Hyped up syched up ready for wil'in'
Standing in a crowd of girls like an island
I see the one I want to sic come here cutie
I flip 'em around and then I work that booty

Work the body work work the body
Slow down girl you're 'bout to hurt somebody
Oh and yo let's get just one thing clear
There's only one reason why I came here

Ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (go)
Ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (go)
Ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (go)
I came here tonight to hear the crowd go


Boom! shake-shake-shake the room
Boom! shake-shake-shake the room
Boom! shake-shake-shake the room
Tic-tic-tic-tic Boom!
Well yo are y'all ready for me yet
(pump it up prince)
Well yo are y'all ready for me yet
(pump it up prince)
Well yo are y'all ready for me yet
(pump it up prince)
Well here I go here I go here I here I go

Yo
Dance in the aisles when the prince steps to it
The rhyme is a football y'all and I went and threw it
Out in the crowd and yo it was a good throw

How do I know? because the crowd went hoooo
In response to the way that I was kicking it
Smooth and individual
Rhymes always original

Like the Dr. Jekyl man and this is my Hyde side
I am the driver and you're on a rap ride
So fellas (yeah)
Are y'all wit me (yeah)

I said fellas (yeah)
Are y'all wit me (yeah)
Why don't you tell the girls what y'all want to do
Ya want to ooh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh--ooooh

That's right yo and I'm in the flow
So pump up the volume along with the tempo
I want everybody in the house to know
I came here tonight to hear the crowd go



Pump it pump it come on now 

Yeah, come on now



Here I go
The the f-f-f-f-fresh p-p-p-prince is who I am
So tell my mother that I never wrote a whack jam
But some times I get n-nervous and start to stutter

And I f-fumble every word for word I utter
So I just try to ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chill
But it gets worse-a but worse-a but-but-but worse still
I need the see-see-see-crowd to k-k-k-kick into it

They help me calm down and I can get through it
So higher higher
Get ya hands to the ceiling
Let it go y'all don't fight the feeling

Mic in a strangle hold sweat pourin'
And like Jordan yo I'm scoring
Yeah that's right y'all and I am in the flow
So pump up the volume along with the tempo

Many have died tryin' to stop my show
I came here tonight to here the crowd go
