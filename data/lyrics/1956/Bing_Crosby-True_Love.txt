Suntanned, windblown
Honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par
Oh, how lucky we are

While I give to you
And you give to me
True love, true love

So on and on
It'll always be
True love, true love

For you and I have a guardian angel
On high, with nothin' to do
But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever true

For you and I have a guardian angel
On high, with nothing to do
But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever true
Love forever true
