When my jukebox baby takes the floor
'Round the old jukebox in the candy store
The joint starts jumpin' till the roof comes tumblin' down
(Choo-choo-wah, choo-choo-wah, shooby-doo-wah)
Jukebox baby, you're the swingin'est doll in town

Jukebox baby, put a nickel in for Maybelline
Jukebox baby, drop another one for Seventeen
Jukebox baby, whisper to your daddy-oh
Three little love words, Kokomo

How ya gonna get your homework done
When you keep that jukebox on the run
You don't dig Latin like ya dig that crazy sound
(Choo-choo-wah, choo-choo-wah, shooby-doo-wah)
Jukebox baby, you're the swingin'est doll in town

Jukebox baby, I hear you knockin'
Jukebox baby, keep the coin box hoppin'
Jukebox baby, tell me sincerely
That you ain't forgettin' no Tina Marie

Hip-hip, hop-hop, ho-ho, aww, hah
Oh, jukebox baby, my jukebox baby, jukebox baby
Jukebox baby, jukebox baby, jukebox baby

All your lunchtime money goes down the slot
You could live on air if the music's hot
You just ain't quittin' till ya rock that clock around
(Choo-choo-wah, choo-choo-wah, shooby-doo-wah)
Jukebox baby, you're the swingin'est doll in town

See ya later
Alligator
Oh hey, ring-a-dinga
What a dungaree doll I've found
Run them there now
Jukebox baby, jukebox baby
You're the wingin'est
Dingin'est, swingin'est doll in town
