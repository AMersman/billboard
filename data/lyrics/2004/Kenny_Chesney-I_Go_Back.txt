'Jack and Diane' painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song

I go back to a two-ton short bed Chevy
Drivin' my first love out to the levee
Livin' life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

Well, I used to rock all night long
To 'keep on rock'n me, baby'
At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause everytime I hear that song

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that's somehow stamped our lives
That takes us to another place and time

So, I go back to the pew, preacher and a choir
Singin' 'bout God and brimstone and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now, 'Only The Good Die Young' stops me in my tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back
(I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back
(I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back
I go back
