Starry night, sunny days 
I always thought that love should be that way 
Then comes a time that you're really in doubt 
You've loved all you can and now you're all loved out 
Ooo baby we've been a long long way 
And who's to say were we'll be tomorrow 
Well my heart says no 
But my mind says it's so 
We've got a love 
Is it a love to stay 

We've got a wham bam shang-a-lang and a sha-la-la-la thing
We've got a wham bam shang-a-lang and a sha-la-la-la thing

Looking at you I wanted to say 
I think a little emotion goes a long long way 
Careful now don't get caught in no dreams 
Look out baby this is not what it seems 
Ooo baby you've been so good to me. 

But Please don't make it what it's not.
Well, I thought we agreed on what we need
So listen to me I'll tell you what we got 

We've got a wham bam shang-a-lang and a sha-la-la-la thing
We've got a wham bam shang-a-lang and a sha-la-la-la thing

I think you're seeing what I've been saying, cause I hear you 

Singing to the tune I am playing
Now that it's been said and we both understand, lets say our 

Goodbyes before it gets out of hand
Bye Bye, Baby I really loved to stay
But we'll remember the best Times in our Lives

We Got to wham bam shang a lang and sha la la la la
