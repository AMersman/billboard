Dave, speaking
Alvin, put that harmonica down.

Alvin, speaking
Why? 

Dave, speaking
Because we're gonna sing, that's why! 

Alvin, speaking
Not again! 

Dave, speaking
Nevermind.
Now look fellas, this is a pretty song
So let's try not to goof it up.
Are you ready, Simon? 

Simon, speaking
Sure, let's go! 

Dave, speaking
All set, Theodore? 

Theodore, speaking
Hot dog, you bet! 

Dave, speaking
Are you ready, Alvin?

Dave, speaking
Ready, Alvin? 

Dave, shouting
ALVIN! 

Alvin, speaking
Aw, nuts! 

Chipmunks
We sure like girls, 
All kind of girls.
From Annie to Veronica! 
We like 'em small or fat or tall...

Alvin
I wanna play my harmonica! 

Dave, speaking
Now cut that out! 

Chipmunks
And if we want to get a kiss, 
We take them fruit or popcorn, 
Because they always fall in love...

Alvin
When I play my harmoni-corn! 

Dave, shouting
Alvin! 

Dave, speaking
Will you put that thing down and sing? 

Alvin, shouting
OK! 

Chipmunks
We sure like girls, 
All kind of girls, 
From Annie to Veronica.
We like 'em small or fat or tall...

Alvin
I'm gonna play my harmonica! 

Dave, speaking
All right, Alvin.
Make a fool of yourself.
Play the harmonica.


Simon and Theodore

Dave, speaking
Now wait a minute, you guys!
Alvin, you're goofing it all up!
This was a pretty song,

You got them all cha-chaing and singing and wrecking the song!
