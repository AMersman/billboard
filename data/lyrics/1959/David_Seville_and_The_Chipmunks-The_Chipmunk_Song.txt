(Dave:) Alright you chipmunks, ready to sing your song?
(Alvin:) I'd say we are
(Theodore:) Yeah, let's sing it now!
(Dave:) Okay, Simon?
(Simon:) OK.
(Dave:) Okay, Theodore?
(Theodore:) OK.
(Dave:) Okay Alvin?... Alvin?... ALVIN!!!
(Alvin:) OKAY!

(Chipmunks:)
Christmas, Christmas time is near
Time for toys and time for cheer
We've been good, but we can't last
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast

Want a plane that loops the loop
(Alvin:) Me, I want a hula-hoop
(Chipmunks:) 
We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas don't be late

(Dave:) Ok fellas, get ready.
That was very good, Simon.
(Simon:) Naturally!
(Dave:) Very good, Theodore.
(Theodore:) He he he he
(Dave:) Uh Alvin, you were a little flat.
Watch it, Alvin... Alvin?... ALVIN!!!
(Alvin:) OKAY!

(Chipmunks:)
Want a plane that loops the loop
(Alvin:) I still want a hula-hoop
(Chipmunks:)
We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas don't be late
We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas don't be late
