Doesn't take much to make me happy
And make me smile with glee
Never, never will I feel discouraged
'Cause our love's no mystery

Demonstrating love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
I like the way ya make me feel about you, baby
Want the whole wide world to see

Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love

Goin' in and out of changes
The kind that come around each day
My life has a better meaning
Love has kissed me in a beautiful way

Oh yeah (my love, my love)
Oh, oh yeah (my love, my love)

Oh, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love

Demonstrating sweet love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
The way I feel about ya, baby can't explain it
Want the whole wide world to see

Oh, but in my heart, you're all I need
You for me and me for you
Oh, it's growin' every day
Oh

Oh, oh oh oh oh oh
You've got the best of my love
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh

My love, oh, my love

My love oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh
