I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Well, every moment spent with you is a moment of treasure

I don't wanna close my eyes, I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing

Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating
And I wonder what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
And then I'd kiss your eyes and thank God were together
I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever, forever and ever

I don't wanna close my eyes, I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing, oh yeah

I don't wanna miss one smile, I don't wanna miss one kiss
I just wanna be with you, right here with you, just like this
I just wanna hold you close and feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment for all the rest of time, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't wanna close my eyes, I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna closer, hey, hey, I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing, oh

I don't wanna close my eyes, I don't wanna fall asleep, yeah
And I don't wanna miss a thing
