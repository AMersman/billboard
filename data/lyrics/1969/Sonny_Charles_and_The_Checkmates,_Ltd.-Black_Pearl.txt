Wooo
Hey, Hey my my black pearl
Precious little girl
Let me put you up where you belong
Black pearl
Pretty little girl
You've been in the background much too long

You've been workin' so hard your whole life through
Tending other peoples houses raising up their children too
Hey how bout something for me and you
Here in my arms you're gonna reign supreme
No more serving baby, they're gonna serve my queen
It's our turn for happiness and our day has come
Living for each other and answering to no one

Black pearl precious little girl
Let me put you up where you belong because I love you
Black pearl pretty little girl
You've been in the background much too long
Together we'll stand so straight and so tall
Created by love to love one and all
Heart to heart, soul to soul
No other one could ever take your place
My world is built around the very smile that's on your face
You'll never win a beauty show no they won't pick you
But you're my Miss America and I love you

Black pearl precious little girl
Let me put you up where you belong, I will lead you
Black pearl pretty little girl
You've been in the background much too long

Oooo my my my baby
You know I need you, you know I want you, want you for myself
I want you, want you for myself where I know you're not with anybody else
