Spoken:
Do you recall the night?
That very, very special night
Do you remember a girl?
That very special girl
Well, to the old and to the new
We rededicate this song to you

Oh, what a night
To love you, dear
Oh, what a night
To hold you near
Oh, what a night
To squeeze you, dear
That's why I love you so

Oh, what a night
To love you, dear
Oh, what a night
To want you, dear
Oh, what a night
To kiss you, dear,
That's why I love you so

I won't forget all those things you have told to me (Yeah)
Things in my heart won't let me forget your love

Oh, what a night (Oh-ho)
To love you, dear
Oh, what a night
To want you, dear
Oh, what a night
To kiss you, dear
That's why I love you so

Oh, what a night
To love you, dear
Oh, what a night
To want you, dear
Oh, what a night
To kiss you, dear
That's why I love you so
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

One more night
Can I walk you home one more night?
I want to make love to you one more night
I love you, baby
I want you, baby
I need you, baby
I love you, baby
One more night
