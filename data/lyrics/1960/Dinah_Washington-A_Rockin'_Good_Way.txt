If you're gonna give me good kisses like that
Honey, don'tcha know I'm gonna give 'em right back

That's a kissin' good way
(That's a kissin' good way)
Ahh, that's a kissin' good way
(That's a kissin' good way)
Now, that's a kissin' good way to mess around and fall in love
(Don't mess around, don't mess around)

If you're gonna start out by huggin' me tight
Don't mess around, just a-hug me right

'Cause that's a huggin' good way
(That's a huggin' good way)
Brook, that's a huggin' good way
(That's a huggin' good way)
That's a huggin' good way to mess around and fall in love
(Don't mess around, don't mess around)

Ya know you called me on the phone
And just because I was alone
Yes, you came around wooin'
Ahh, you'd better ask somebody if you don't know what you're doin'

Now you kissed me and you rocked my soul
And don't come around knockin' rock 'n' roll

'Cause that's a rockin' good way
(That's a rockin' good way)
Yes, that's a rockin' good way
(That's a rockin' good way)
That's a rockin' good way to mess around and fall in love
(Don't mess around, don't mess around)

Well, you know you called me on the phone
And just because I was alone
You came around a-wooin'
You better ask somebody if you don't know what you're doin'

Mmm, now that you've kissed me and rocked my soul
Don't come around knockin' rock 'n' roll

That's a rockin' good way
(That's a rockin' good way)
Dinah, that's a rockin' good way
(That's a rockin' good way)
That's a rockin' good way to mess around and fall in love

You better know it baby, it's a rockin' good way
And I loved to rock, how 'bout you?
Ahh, baby, you got what it takes
Ain't that somethin'? You dig the rock

I say
Cool
Stay out of my spot
Oh yeah
Alright
Oh yeah, I like the spot, don't you know?
Alright
Alright
You got it man
