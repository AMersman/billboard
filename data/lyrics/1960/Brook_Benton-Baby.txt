Well, now, it takes more than a Robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
Well, it takes two hearts a-cookin' to make a fire grow
And baby a-you've got what it takes, yeah
You know it takes a lot of kissin'

Tell me about it, to make a romance sweet
Ooh, it takes a lot of lovin' to make my life complete
And it takes a lot of woman now, to knock me off my feet
And baby, you've got it what it takes

I said, you know you've got just what it takes
Because it takes more than an effort to stay away from you
It'd take more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true
But it takes somebody special to make me say, "I do"
Oh, yeah, and baby a-you've got what it takes

You know you've got just what it takes
Because it takes oh yeah
You're back in my spot again, honey
I like your spot, to stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
It takes more than a lifetime, Daddy, to prove that I'll be true

Now it's you
But, it takes somebody special
Like me, baby, to make me say, "I do"
And baby a-you've got what it takes

C'mon, let's play it again, huh?
C'mon, let's do it one more time, all right?
And baby a-you've got what it takes
One more time, Brook
And baby you've got what it takes
