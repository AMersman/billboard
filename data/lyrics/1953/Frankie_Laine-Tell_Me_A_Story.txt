Tell me story, tell me story
Tell me story, remember what you said
You promised me you said you would
You got to give in, so I'll be good
Tell me a story then I'll go to bed

Oh, worry, worry, weary ends my day
Comes the time to go home without my raise in pay
Home by the fire where a man can just relax
Sippers there by the chair, not a worry, not a care
Along comes Junior swinging his little axe

Tell me a story, tell me a story
Tell me a story, remember what you said
Tell me about the birds and bees
How do you make a chicken sneeze?
Tell me a story then I'll go to bed

Came home so late one evening last July
Played a little poker the time had passed me by
Shoes in my hand and my darlin' wife in bed
Up the stairs sayin' a prayer
Then a voice comes through the air

Hi you there, daddy
Remember what you said

Tell me a story, tell me a story
Tell me a story, remember what you said
Tell me how your eye got black
Because the doorway hit you back
Tell me a story then I'll go to bed

Once upon a time I remember long ago
Don't go back in history, your memory's kinda slow
Stop your noisy talkin' until I finish with my tale

Once upon a, upon a what
Upon your back, you'll get a swat
Tell me about the fish you caught
That's was bigger than a whale

Tell me a story, tell me a story
Tell me a story, remember what you said
You promised me, you said you would
You gotta give in, so I'll be good

Here's a tale you'll never forget
(Tap, tap, tap)
Ouch, my tails all red
And now get up to bed
Ha, ha come on daddy, tell me a story, hee, hee
