Anytime you're feelin' lonely
Anytime you're feelin' blue
Anytime you feel down-hearted
That will prove your love for me is true

Anytime you're thinkin' 'bout me
That's the time I'll be thinkin' of you
So anytime you say, you're gonna want me back again
That's the time I'm gonna come back home to you

Anytime you're thinkin' 'bout me
That's the time I'll be thinkin' of you
So anytime you say, you're gonna want me back again
That's the time I'm gonna come back home to you
Come back home, anytime
