You Are On My Mind, You Are On My Mind


Every Little Thing I Do You're On My Mind
The Way I Feel Lately, It's Driving Me Crazy
Every Little Thing I Do You're On My Mind
I Can't Get Over You, I Think About You All The Time

Can't You See What You Do To Me
I Think About You All The Time
My Mind Is Hazy And I'm Mixed Up Feeling Crazy Over You
Let's Not Waste Anytime



Round And Round I Go, Where I'll Stop Only You Know
I Guess It's All In My Mind
Take Your Time Think It Over Let Me Know
What You Wanna Do, Baby It's So Good



Every Little Thing I Do You're On My Mind
You're On My Mind, Hey...
