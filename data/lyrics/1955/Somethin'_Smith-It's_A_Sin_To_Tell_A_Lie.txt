Be sure it's true when you say "I love you"
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken
I love you, yes I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true when you say "I love you"
It's a sin to tell a lie
Cross my heart and I hope to die
I'll never, never, ever tell another white lie
Took a little doll out on a date last night
Next to her, *Gravel Gertie* would have looked all right
Now I'm between the devil and the deep blue sea
'cause I said "Baby, you look good to me"
I told her I loved her but, oh, how I lied
And now she's gettin' set to be my blushin' bride
If she leads me to the altar, then I'm sunk
cause I can't tell the preacher I was drunk
So Lord have mercy on a no 'count sinner
Give me one more chance to let another guy win 'er
Cross my heart and I hope to die
I'll never, never, EVER tell another white lie.
Be sure it's true when you say "I love you"
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken
I love you, yes I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true when you say "I love you"
It's a sin to tell a lie
