Josie's on a vacation far away 
Come around and talk it over 
So many things that I wanna say 
You know I like my girls a little bit older 
I just wanna use your love tonight 
I don't wanna lose your love tonight 

I ain't got many friends left to talk to 
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble 
You know I'd do anything for you 
Stay the night but keep it undercover 
I just wanna use your love tonight, whoa
I don't wanna lose your love tonight 

Tryin' to stop my hands from shakin' 
But something in my mind's not making sense 
It's been a while since we were all alone 
I can't hide the way I'm feeling

As you leave me, please, would you close the door?
And don't forget what I told you 
Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong 
Another shoulder to cry upon 
I just wanna use your love tonight, yeah
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Yeah, I just wanna use your love tonight 
I don't wanna lose your love tonight 
I just wanna use your love tonight 
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

(Use your love)
(Lose your love)
Your love
(Use your love)
Oh, I don't wanna lose
(Lose your love) (Tonight)
No, I don't wanna, no, I don't wanna
No, I don't wanna lose
(Use your love) (Tonight)
Your love, your love
(Lose your love) (Tonight)
Your love
(Use your love) (Tonight)
Your love
(I don't wanna lose your love tonight)
