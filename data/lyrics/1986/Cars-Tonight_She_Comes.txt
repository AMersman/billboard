I know tonight she comes
She's taking a swipe at fun
She gives me a reason for sighting my sights
Well, I know tonight she comes

She jangles me up
She does it with ease
Sometimes she passes through me
Just like a breeze
She gives me a reason for feelin' alright

Oh, well 
(Know tonight, I know tonight)
I know tonight 
(Know tonight, I know tonight)
I know tonight 
(Know tonight, I know tonight)
She comes

And I know she's gonna do it to me 
One more time (One more time)
I know she's gonna stay implanted
In my mind
Why does she keep me hanging on the line, oh
(Why does she keep me hanging on the line?)

Ah, yeah, I know she's gonna do it to me
One more time (One more time)
I know she's gonna stay implanted
In my mind
Oh, why does she keep me hanging on the line?
(Why does she keep me hanging on the line?)
Oh, yeah

I know the way she feels
And all of the hearts that she steals
She tells me it's easy when you do it right
Oh, well
Well, I know tonight she comes

She tells me it's easy when you do it right
(Know tonight, I know tonight)
I know tonight 
(Know tonight, I know tonight)
I know tonight 
(Know tonight, I know tonight)
She comes

(Know tonight, I know tonight)
I know, oh, yeah
(I know tonight)
Well, I know tonight 
(Know tonight, I know tonight)
Tonight she comes
