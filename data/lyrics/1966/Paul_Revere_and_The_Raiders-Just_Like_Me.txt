It's just like me
To say to you
Love me do
And I'll be true

And what I'd like
For you to say
Is you'll come home
To me each day

Now you'll be my girl
That's what I want
Just you sweet girl
And not a front

It's just like me
To feel so blue
And fall so much
In love with you

It's just like me
It's just like me
I'm just your fool
That's all I'll be

But it's just like you
To say goodbye
And leave me all
Alone to cry, waaa

It's just like me
To say to you
Love me do
And I'll be true

And what I'd like
For you to say
Is that you'll love me
Here each day

It's just like me
It's just like me
I'm your fool
That's how I'll be

But it's just like you
To say goodbye
And leave me alone
Alone to cry

It's just like me
It's just like me...
