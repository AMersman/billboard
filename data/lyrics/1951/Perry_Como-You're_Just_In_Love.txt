I hear singing and there's no one there, 
I smell blossoms and the trees are bare, 
All day long I seem to walk on air, 
I wonder why, I wonder why ? 

I keep tossing in my sleep at night, 
And what's more I've lost my appetite, 
Stars that used to twinkle in the skies, 
Are twinkling in my eyes, 
I wonder why ? 

You don't need analyzin' 
It is not so surpisin' 
That you feel very strange but nice! 
Your heart goes pitter patter 
I know just what's the matter 
Because I've been there once or twice! 

Put your head on my shoulder 
You need someone who's older 
A rub-down with a velvet glove! 
There is nothing you can take 
To relieve that pleasant ache 
You're not sick, you're just in love! 

 

Now you know why! 
Now I know why! 
I'm just in love!
