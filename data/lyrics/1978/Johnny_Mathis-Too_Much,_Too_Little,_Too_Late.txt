Johnny:
Yes, it's over, call it a day
Sorry that it had to end this way
No reason to pretend
We knew it had to end some day, this way

Deniece:
Guess it's over, the kicks are gone
What's the use of tryin' to hang on
Somewhere we lost the key
So little left for you and me and it's clear to see

Both:
Too much, too little, too late to lie again with you
Too much, too little, too late to try again with you
We're in the middle of ending something that we knew

Johnny: It's over
Deniece: Oh, it was over

Both:
Too much, too little, too late to ever try again
Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end

Deniece: Ah, it's over
Johnny: It's over

Deniece:
Guess it's over, the chips are down (whoa)
Nearly all our bridges tumbled down

Johnny:
Whatever chance we try, let's face it, why deny
It's over (It's over)
It's over

Both:
Too much, too little, too late to ever try again
Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end

Johnny: And it's over
Deniece: And it's over
Johnny: And it's over

Both:
Too much, too little, too late to ever try again
Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
