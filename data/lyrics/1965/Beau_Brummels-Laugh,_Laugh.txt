I hate to say it
But I told you so
Don't mind my preaching to you

I said don't trust him
Baby, now you know
You don't learn everything
There is to know in school

Wouldn't believe me
When I gave advice
I said that he was a tease
If you want help
You better ask me nice
So be sincere, convince me
With a "pretty please"

Laugh, laugh, I thought I'd die
It seemed so funny to me
Laugh, laugh, you met a guy
Who taught you how it feels to be
Lonely, oh, so lonely

Don't think I'm being funny
When I say you got
Just what you deserve
I can't help feeling
You found out today
You thought you were too good
You had a lot of nerve

Won't say I'm sorry
For the things I've said
I'm glad he packed up to go
You kept on bragging
He was yours instead
You found you don't know everything
There is to know

Laugh, laugh, I thought I'd die
It seemed so funny to me
Laugh, laugh, you met a guy
Who taught you how it feels to be
Lonely, oh, so lonely

Before I go
I got to say one thing
Don't close your ears to me
Take my advice and
You'll find out that being
Just another girl
Won't cause you misery

Don't say you can
Get any boy to call
Don't be so smug or else
You'll find you can't
Get any boy at all
You'll wind up an old lady
Sitting on a shelf

Laugh, laugh, I thought I'd die
It seemed so funny to me
Laugh, laugh, you met a guy
Who taught you how it feels to be
Lonely, oh, so lonely

Lonely, oh, so lonely....
