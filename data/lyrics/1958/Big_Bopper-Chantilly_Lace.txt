Hello baby, yeah, this is the Big Bopper speaking
Oh you sweet thing
Do I what?
Will I what?
Oh baby, you know what I like!

Chantilly lace
And a pretty face
And a pony tail hanging down
That wiggle in the walk
And giggle in the talk
Makes the world go round
There ain't nothing in the world
Like a big eyed girl
That makes me act so funny
Make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose
Like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby that's what I like!

What's that baby?
But - but - but - oh honey!
But - oh baby you know what I like!

Chantilly lace
And a pretty face
And a pony tail hanging down
That wiggle in the walk
And giggle in the talk
Makes the world go round
There ain't nothing in the world
Like a big eyed girl
That makes me act so funny
Make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose
Like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby that's what I like!

What's that honey?
Pick you up at eight
And don't be late?
But baby I ain't got no money, honey!
Oh, alright baby, you know what I like!

Chantilly lace
And a pretty face
And a pony tail hanging down
That wiggle in the walk
And giggle in the talk
Makes the world go round
There ain't nothing in the world
Like a big eyed girl
That makes me act so funny
Make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose
Like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby that's what I like!
