I know a cat named Way Out Willie
He's got a cool little chick named Rockin' Millie
He can walk and stroll and Susie Q
And do that crazy hand jive too

Papa told Willie, "you'll ruin my home
You and that hand jive have got to go"
Willie said, "Papa, don't put me down
They're doin' the hand jive all over town"

(Chorus)
Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Doin' that crazy hand jive

Mama, Mama look at Uncle Joe
He's doin' that hand jive with sister Flo
Grandma gave baby sister a dime
Said, "do that hand jive one more time"

Doctor and the lawyer and Indian chief
Now they all dig that crazy beat
Way Out Willie gave 'em all a treat
When he did that hand jive with his feet

(Chorus)

Willie and Millie got married last fall
They had a little Willie Junior and that ain't all
Well, the baby got famous and it's plain to see
Doin' that hand jive on TV

Chorus)
