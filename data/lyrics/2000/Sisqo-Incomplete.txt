Whoo
Ooh
Oh yeah yeah
Listen

Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now

Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune, still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

So, I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl, my life is incomplete
Said without you girl, ahh listen

Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl, I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday, you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was

It's been a year, winter summer spring and fall
But bein' without you just ain't livin', ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl, my life is incomplete
That without you girl ahh

I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything and everything
To hear you say that you'll stay

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women (all the women)
All the expensive cars (all the money)
All of the money don't amount to you (you can have it all)

I can make believe I have everything (just give me my baby)
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl (without you)
My life is incomplete (alright, alright, alight, alright)

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women (I don't have you)
All the expensive cars (I don't have you)
All of the money don't amount to you (it makes me wanna cry)

I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl (without you)
My life is incomplete

Without ya girl
Without ya girl my life
Without you girl
My life my life is incomplete
Without you girl
My life is incomplete
Oh yeah
My life is incomplete
Oh yeah yeah
Whoo
