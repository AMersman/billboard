I dig rock and roll music
And I love to get the chance to play (And sing it)
I figure it's about the happiest sound goin' down today
The message may not move me
Or mean a great deal to me
But hey! It feels so groovy to say

I dig The Mamas & The Papas at the trip Sunset Strip in L.A.
And they got a good thing goin' when the words don't get in the way
And when they're really wailing
Michelle and Cass are sailin'
Hey! They really nail me to the wall

I dig Donovan in a dream-like, tripped out way
His crystal images, hey, they tell you 'bout a brighter day
And when The Beatles tell you
They've got a word "love" to sell you
They mean exactly what they say

I dig rock and roll music
I could really get it on in that scene
I think I could say somethin' if you know what I mean
But if I really say it
The radio won't play it
Unless I lay it between the lines
