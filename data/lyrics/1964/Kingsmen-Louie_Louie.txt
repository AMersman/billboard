Louie, Louie, oh no, said we gotta go
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah said
Louie, Louie, oh baby, said we gotta go

A fine little girl she waiting for me
Catch a ship across the sea
Sail that ship all alone
Me never think how I'll make it home

Louie, Louie, nah, nah, nah, no, said we gotta go
Oh no, said
Louie, Louie, oh baby, said we gotta go

(Fuck!)
Three night and day I sail the sea
Think of girl oh constantly
Oh on that ship, I dream she there
I smell the rose oh in her hair

Louie, Louie, oh no, said we gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah said 
Louie, Louie, oh baby, said we gotta go

Okay, let's give it to 'em, right now! 

See
See Jamaica my moon above
It won't be long me see me love
Take her in my arms and then
I tell her I'll never leave again

Louie, Louie, oh no, said we gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah said
Louie, Louie, oh baby, said we gotta go

I said we gotta go now

Let's get on outta here

Let's go!
