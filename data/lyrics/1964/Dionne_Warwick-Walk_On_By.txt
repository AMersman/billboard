If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by

Make believe
That you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve
In private 'cause each time I see you
I break down and cry

Yeah, Walk on by (don't stop)
Mm, walk on by (don't stop)
Mm, walk on by

I just can't get over losing you
And so if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by, walk on by

Foolish pride
That's all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye

They'll walk on by (don't stop)
Mm, walk on by (don't stop)
Mm, walk on by (don't stop)
Mm, Walk on

Walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride
Is all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye

Mm, walk on by (don't stop)
Mm, walk on by (don't stop)
Now you really gotta walk on by (don't, don't stop)
Baby never even see the tears I cry (don't, don't stop)
Now you really gotta walk on by (don't, don't stop)
Mm-mm-hmm, baby, never see the tears I cry
Now you really gotta walk on by
