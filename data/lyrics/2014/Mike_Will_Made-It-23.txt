I'm in the club, high on purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on

I be in the club standing on the couch (the couch)
In them Wolf Grays like it's my house (what, I'm home)
Drinking out the bottle, I got no respect (hey)
Looking like a model, you just got a check (change)
I back it up, cause I don't give a fuck (I don't)
If you're a lame, that's a shame you can't hang with us (uh uh)
I'm MC Hammer fly, you can't touch (fresh, nope)
J's so fly I should work at Flight Club

Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I’m naughty by nature like I’m hip-hop hooray
With my hands in the sky, I wave ‘em from side to side
My feet on the floor, I’m ’bout to turn up now

I'm in the club, high on purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on

Wiz Khalifa
I be rockin' J's or I be rockin' Taylors
I got lots of flavors, my kick game is major
More kicks than the players, call me up I'm scorin'
Hit it like a free throw, tongue out like I'm Jordan
Smiley, Miley, come swing the thing right by me
Gotta a joint if you wanna get stoned, got choppers if they wanna try me
Pro athlete I'm not no wannabe
Waitress asked how many bottles? I said 23

I stay showin' out, my kick game is a beast (mm hmm, mm hmm)
I got thirty pair of J's that ain't never been released (you know it)
Flu game twelve, Space Jam 11 (hoes, bitch)
On the hype beast sick, they gon' need a paramedic
Turn up, turn up, turn up, I got trippy, I stay live (hoes)
All this purple in my cup, match them grape 5's (we sippin')
I'm so high, I got three bitches that go bi (pussies)
I'm so fly, I'm gettin' head like a blow dryer
