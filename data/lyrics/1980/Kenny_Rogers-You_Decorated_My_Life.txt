All my life was a paper
Once plain, pure and white
'Til you moved with your pen
Changing moods now and then
'Til the balance was right
Then you added some music
Every note was in place
And anybody could see
All the changes in me
By the look on my face

And you decorated my life
Created a world
Where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life
By painting your love
All over my heart
You decorated my life

Like a rhyme with no reason
In an unfinished song
There was no harmony
Life meant nothin' to me
Until you came along
And you brought out the colors
What a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see
All the things life can be
Shining soft in your eyes

And you decorated my life
Created a world
Where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life
By painting your love
All over my heart
You decorated my life
