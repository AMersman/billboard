Find a wheel, and it goes round, round, round, 
As it skims along with a happy sound, 
As it goes, along the ground, ground, ground, 
‘Till it leads you to the one you love! 

Then your love, will hold you round, round, round, 
And your heart's a song with a brand new sound, 
And your head, goes spinnin' round, round, round, 
‘Cause you found what you've been dreamin' of! 

In the night you see the oval moon, 
Goin' round and round in tune. 
And the ball of sun in the day, 
Makes a girl and boy wanna say: 

Find a ring, ( find a ring . . . ) and put it round, round, round, 
And with ties so strong the two hearts are bound, 
Put it on, ( put it on . . . ) the one you found, found, found, 
For you kno' that this is really love! ( . . . this is really love! ) 

Find a wheel, ( find a wheel . . . ) and it goes round, round, round, 
As it skims along with a happy sound, 
As it goes, ( as it goes . . . ) along the ground, ground, ground, 
‘Till it leads you to the one you love! ( . . . to the one you love! ) 

Then your love, ( then your love ) you'll hold her round, round, round, 
And your heart's a song with a brand new sound, 
And your head, ( and your head ) goes spinning round, round, round, 
‘Cause you found what you've been dreamin' of! ( . . . you've been dreamin' of! ) 

In the night you see the oval moon, 
Goin' round and round in tune ( going round and round! ) 
And the ball of sun in the day, 
Makes a girl and boy wanna say: ( wanna say, wanna say! ) 

Find the ring, ( find the ring . . . ) and put it round, round, round,

For you kno' that this is really love, 
Really love . . . really love . . . hmmm!
