Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody –
When you croon
Croon a tune
From the heart of Dixie!

Just hang my cradle, mammy mine
Right on the Mason Dixon line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee with all the love that's in ya!

Weep no more, weep no more, my lady
Sing that song again for me
So soft and low, just as though
You had me on your knee!

A million baby kisses, that I would deliver
The minute that you sing the Swanee River –
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody!

Oh, weep no more, my lady
Sing that song again for me
So soft and low
Just as though
You had me on your knee!

A million baby kisses, that I would deliver
The minute that you sing the Swanee River –
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody!
